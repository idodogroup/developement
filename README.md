# DoDo | Smart city logistics



## :truck: About DoDo
[DoDo](http://idodo.cz/en/) is unstoppable! We grow every year not only in the Czech Republic but also abroad and we have big plans. We are a data-driven logistics service for e-commerce, retail and fast food. We use advanced technology to make it easier for companies to deliver goods and reduce the negative impact on the urban environment. DoDo has been operating successfully since December 2015. During its existence, DoDo has served hundreds of thousands customers. 

Based on data, we solve the problems of urban logistics and last miles, in order to save customers' time and deliver the goods to them exactly when they need it and where it suits them. We are building a unique logistics data-driven platform GAIA, thanks to which we can improve companies' logistics and customer experience. We are experts in city logistics and last mile solutions. We provide express delivery, arrange purchases for you or arrange services. At the same time, we operate as a smart courier service that improves logistics for other companies such as Košík.cz, iTesco.cz, KFC and PizzaHut or Bibloo.cz, SuperZoo.cz, Zoot.cz and many others.

Not only our cars are green, but also our thinking. We use modern technology to deliver as many orders as possible with the lowest possible negative impact on the city. With our own fleet of CNG vehicles, we test new logistics models and routes to ecological logistics. Sustainability and consideration are simply part of everyone's DNA in DoDo.

## :office: Offices
In 2021, we moved to the new [Scott.Weber Workspace - Praga Office & Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/tVbaARxErq7eEGBW9) offices. DoDo occupies 2 floors (and one quarter of the highest floor). Almost one whole floor is solely dedicated to the developement team so they have quiet environment for their work.

## :rocket: Open positions
Join us to change the future of urban logistics for the better. We do not know bureaucracy, complicated processes and inflexible decision-making. We are a startup and we do not waste time and even though everything is about speed, we can stop. We organize adventurous teambuildings and barbecue parties on our terrace.
