That’s our vision, which we are following. We manage our company-wide strategy using OKRs. Everyone thus knows what our goals are and where we are heading. To keep us on track, we are hosting All Hands meetings every quarter - everyone can know how the company is doing - it's not a matter of a select few.

### ℹ️ About DODO

We're DODO, a technology and logistics company that provides comprehensive solutions in the field of urban logistics. We are constantly improving our services and our goal is to be an even stronger partner for B2B clients in e-commerce, retail, or fast food. From an originally small start-up, we have grown into a stable company that currently operates in seven countries and is expanding into other European markets.

DODO was founded in 2015 as a start-up with personal assistant services. However, we quickly expanded our logistics services and launched delivery in the country’s largest cities. In 2018, we expanded into Slovakia and Poland. We are now operating in seven countries and are still growing.

### 🚀 Challenges we are currently solving

You won’t miss our iconic green cars. But it’s not just our large fleet of CNG vehicles that makes us a sought-after B2B logistics partner. Our unique product is GAIA, a logistics platform through which the dispatching department communicates with couriers as well as the complete organization and planning of orders from our clients. Through the collected data, we optimize all processes and other functions. Our goal is to make urban logistics more efficient and sustainable.

- **Delivery application** to be a reliable tool for 2500+ couriers in 7 countries.
- **Vehicle routing and capacity optimization** to be effective, economic, and lower negative impacts on the environment.
- **Modules to support back-office processes**, fleet, operations, finance, and HR processes rely on GAIA.
- **Interface for dispatch and order distribution automation** to make the work of our dispatchers easier.
- **Warehouse and picking application** for clients who need to prepare the order in addition to delivery.
- **Customer portal** so that clients are always informed how we are doing with delivery.
- **Order tracking** so that customers can conveniently track their order.
- **Dynamic pricing** so that clients can use our capacities efficiently and economically.
- **Shift Marketplace** for couriers to conveniently plan their shifts.

### 👨‍💻 Approach to development & our tech stack

We are Agile. Teams for which it makes sense, work in 2-week sprints, some teams (for instance research and development team) where tasks are not possible to split into tasks which would fit into sprints use Kanban. We are not working exactly as Scrum Guide dictates, but we bend Scrum, so it works for us. But you still will find these ceremonies in your calendar:
- Sprint planning
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective

> **What about daily stand-ups?**
> 
> Depends on the team. Some smaller teams meet through Slack to call. But mostly we use [Standup Alice](https://standupalice.com/) a Slack bot.

We are keen on keeping our stack up-to-date. Back-end stack is based mainly on generally known Microsoft technologies as we are a Microsoft Gold Partner. We use .NET 6 framework, our applications run in Azure (Azure Cosmos DB, Storage, SQL, Web Apps, Queue & Functions, Automation, Application Insights, LogicApps, ...), we use Entity Framework and SignalR.

On Front-End we use Angular 13 for web application written in TypeScript and Ionic Framework for mobile application. We keep all our apps in one monorepo (Nrwl Nx) to share code.

### 🤝 Our team & Open vacancies

As DODO grows in terms of number of partners, employees, and cities we are delivering in, we need to strengthen our development department and dedicated teams, so GAIA grows sustainably and in accordance with roadmap and our partners demands for custom development. Thus, we are looking for large number of new people that would help us with development.

Our development team in 2 years became development department which now counts about 70 people and 8 main teams with distinct competencies.

**Software Development**
Divided into 4 sub teams. These teams care for specifics projects (Delivery app, picking app, customer portal, order tracking, …) and are composed of a Tech / Team Lead and both Back-End and Front-End Developer (and some Full Stack Developers).

**R&D**
Divided into 2 sub teams. R&D pushes technological innovation and oversees 2 strategic long-term projects – Tyché and Chronos. One is engine for planning routes and capacity optimalization and the other one is an algorithm that can predict our free capacities in individual zones based on historical data.

### 💼 Work at DODO

You cand find our office in Prague - Karlín. DODO CZ&SK, Development and Group HQ is based in [Scott.Weber Workspace Praga Office & Garden](https://scottweber.cz/location/praga-office-garden/), near metro B (Křižíková). We have whole 2nd floor dedicated to development department so that colleagues who choose to go to office can have calm and silent space to be focused on their work.
As for working hours, we have core hours from 10.00 to 15.00 where we are trying to plan most of the regular meetings / ceremonies. It is up to you, if you prefer to work in the early morning or late in the evening.

> **What about overtimes?**
> 
> Overtimes happen but we don't order them. Some do it voluntarily, some don't. Some compensate it in the form of time off, some don't.
> A special case of overtime is overnight and weekend on-call support - this applies to some experienced Back-End Developers (it's about being able to solve any critical outage yourself quickly, for example at 3 a.m.) - of course we properly financially compensate this (approx. 2 times more compared to the legal minimums), both passive on-call, as well as possible active problem solving. It is of course voluntary.

We are also open to remote work and home office. For product activities, personal contact is often important, for development activities it can be advantageous to fully concentrate in the environment of one's own home. With us, you always have a choice, we care about the result.

> **Do you require regular attendance at office?**
> 
> Not really, there are developers who are working from Slovakia or different corners of Czechia and choose to come to office once per 2 weeks to attend sprint plannings, retrospectives and other scrum meetings, but it is not something we require. Mostly these ceremonies are mix of remote and onsite colleagues.

Only time we like whole development department together onsite is a **DevCon** – day which is devoted to retrospective on previous quarter where teams are presenting what they have been doing and what is their focus in next quarter. Part of DevCon is often workshop on different topics, Q&A from our CTO, and member of dev board (Head of Development, Head of Product, Head of QA, etc.). Important part of DevCon is also a dinner, beer, and leisure activities (laser game is especially popular) to bond with both new and old colleagues.
